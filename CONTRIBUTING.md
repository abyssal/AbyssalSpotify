# AbyssalSpotify Contributing Guidelines
AbyssalSpotify is an open-source project. If you are planning on contributing, please take note of the following conventions:

### Coding style
This project conforms to the coding style guidelines set out by the .NET Foundation in [codefx/coding-style.md](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md).
In general, you should try to follow the coding style of the file you're editing, or the guidelines set out by a member in a Pull Request.

### Development
Before submitting a PR, please either open an issue to initiate discussion, or join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RsRps9M) and open a discussion in the `as-help-and-dev` channel.  
This ensures that other developers can note what you want to do, and also provide suggestions and constructive criticism.

### Documentation
AbyssalSpotify has a very strict documentation policy, and it would be great if all Pull Requests could follow it. AbyssalSpotify prefers verbose documentation over too little,
and as such, documentation on new types, members, and methods should be fully complete in correct English syntax. This includes Sandcastle tags like
`<summary>`, `<typeparam>`/`<parameter>`, `<exception>`, `<remarks>`, and `<return>`.

### Conduct
The Code of Conduct which should be followed in all discussions is available [here.](https://github.com/abyssal512/AbyssalSpotify/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
