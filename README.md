<h1 align="center">SpotiNET ðŸŽ¶</h1>
A Spotify API wrapper for .NET Standard 2.1.  
  
Currently, there are no stable releases, although the latest pre-release is fairly stable and should work in your production builds. When updating, always check the commit notes. 

### Usage
Documentation is a work-in-progress. You can see `AbyssalSpotify.Tests\Program.cs` for a brief example, 
but XML documentation is included with all public-facing classes and methods. You can also generate the documentation using DocFX and browse it locally. If you have any issues, feel free to open a GitHub issue.
